# Hands-on RDF exercise

- Go to [example.ttl](https://github.com/amirwesthoff/240110-Introduction-Linked-Data-WET-session/blob/main/example.ttl) and try to understand the RDF data
- Copy it to simple notepad or code editor, add a few RDF triples about yourself. Be creative if you want to add other kinds of info!
- First validate the RDF data using [this website](http://ttl.summerofcode.be/). Note: It is likely that you'll trip over incorrect usage of periods, spaces and semi-colons.
- Then save as a .ttl file and send it to me: amir.westhoff@capgemini.com
